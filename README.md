In this scraper I am stripping a google finance stock of its key attributes and then storing them into a tree structured dataset. My goal is to ultimately take this data and create a generalized synopsis of it. This synopsis will then be rendered onto an HTML page.

Right now it is extremely basic and here are some of my future goals:

-I plan on allowing html form input to this script rather than hard-coding in a given URL.

-Writing a function that parses the data and outputs a conclusion to the HTML page.

The meaning behind this idea of mine is to be able to give my opinion on a stock in an automated process that can be understood by a general audience.
